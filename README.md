# Research Agent

This project is a simplified implementation of a research agent based on the paper "The AI Scientist-v2: Workshop-Level Automated Scientific Discovery". The agent is designed to automate the process of scientific discovery, from hypothesis generation to manuscript creation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 and pip installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-agent.git
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the agent:**

    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

-   `data/`: Contains the data used by the agent.
-   `results/`: Contains the results generated by the agent, such as manuscripts.
-   `src/`: Contains the source code of the agent.
    -   `components/`: Contains the different components of the agent, such as the hypothesizer, experiment designer, data analyzer, and manuscript generator.
    -   `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
    -   `agent.py`: The main agent that orchestrates the research process.
-   `tests/`: Contains the tests for the agent.

## Current Development

The research agent is currently in its initial phase of development. The following functionalities have been implemented:

-   **Hypothesis Generation:** The agent can generate a sample hypothesis.
-   **Experiment Design:** The agent can create a sample experiment design.
-   **Data Analysis:** The agent can analyze a sample dataset and calculate the mean of a column.
-   **Manuscript Generation:** The agent can generate a manuscript in Markdown format that summarizes the research findings.

The agent is not yet capable of performing any real research. The current implementation is a proof of concept that demonstrates the basic workflow of the research agent. The next steps will be to replace the placeholder components with more sophisticated implementations that can perform the described tasks in a more realistic and autonomous way.
